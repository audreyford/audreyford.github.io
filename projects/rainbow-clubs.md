This spring (2019) I learned a new programming language.  Up until now I have only had experience with Java, C, and C++.  While I dabbled a bit into HTML/CSS informally, it was my first time actually learning how everything ties into one another.  Javascript, HTML, CSS are popular languages for web development and I really enjoyed learning more about front-end development as that was what had my interest in computer programming.

As the semester went by, we all got in our practice through WoDs (Workout of the Day) assignments and developed our programming experience.  Even though we worked mainly with JavaScript, HTML, CSS; we learned different platforms on how to implement our projects using Underscore, GitHub, React, Meteor, and MongoDB.  All of these new skills I have learned in class was preparing me for my final project; a group project on implementing a webpage application.
  
This group project was over a span of three weeks, working with 3 other teammates.  Our project was called “Rainbow Clubs”, a webpage application for students to browse a well-organized directory for student clubs on campus;  Rainbow for UH Manoa’s “Rainbow Warriors” and for “Having every club under the rainbow”; Catchy?  I thought of the name!  I also learned how to make an organization for our project page in GitHub and became more acquainted with a bunch of features GitHub has to offer!  I made a Github.io project page for the project which includes screenshots of what our project can implement and also helped out in the project itself working on the club pages.
  
The Rainbow Clubs application allowed students to browse clubs already in the UH Manoa directory.  There is different user access such as the admin, moderator, and regular users.  Users are able to sign up for clubs and also rate them. The admin and moderator will regularly check and approve content to make sure nothing inappropriate is posted so regular users can have a fun, safe, environment to actively search and participate in clubs on campus. 
  
Working in a group can be difficult but also has its advantages.  Everyone comes from different skill sets, some more advanced in programming than others but maybe someone has more of an artistic eye to development.  Also, it is towards the end of the semester and some students can get busy.  I try to be mindful and pick up more work when I am free and vice-versa from my teammates.  I think a best practice would be to learn about everyone’s strengths and weaknesses before distributing the project and effective communication will make the process run smoothly.  Overall projects are stressful but in a real-life situation you do not always get to pick your teammates so you will have to learn from them.
