'And you ask "What if I fall?", Oh but darling "What if you fly?"'. -Erin Hanson

<hr>

Back in 2014, I spontaneously joined a beauty pageant.  At first, I thought pageants were all about looks which turned me off from ever considering them but then I learned that it consisted of talented young women with goals and I decided to check it out.  I joined the Miss Chinatown Hawaii pageant because I am half Chinese and wanted to learn more about my cultural heritage.  A typical beauty pageant consists of four catagories: question/answer, swimwear, talent, and evening gown. And so I asked myself "Talent?  But I am not talented?!".  Well I had about eight months to learn something new and perform in front of hundreds of people.

I wanted to do something different for my talent that would 'wow' the judges.  I recently watched a friend of mine perform aerial silks and I thought that looked like a lot of fun, plus it was super cool to watch!  I started aerial classes immediately because I have never worked out before and I had little to no physical strength.  Training was rigorous,  it took me two months to be able to do my first pull up on my own (which is a basic skill to get on the apparatus).  I was definately underestimating the amount of training required so I had to work out five days a week on top of my school and work schedule.  I posted a training video above which was taken during a month before my performance to use as an introduction video.  I accomplished my goal of learning a completely new talent in eight months with a two minute choreography performed infront of hundreds of people.  And the cherry on top is being judged the entire time.  

In the end, I did not place in the pageant but it was a valuable learning experience.  Not only did I push myself physically like I never did before, I came out with a new active lifestyle and hobby.  Alongside with the talent portion, I also pushed my public speaking skills, worked in a team to do choreography, and made a memorable impression to the audience and judges.
