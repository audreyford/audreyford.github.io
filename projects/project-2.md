'And you ask "What if I fall?", Oh but darling "What if you fly?"'. -Erin Hanson

<hr>

Back in 2014, I spontaneously joined a beauty pageant.  At first, I thought pageants were all about looks which turned me off from ever considering them but then I learned that it consisted of talented young women with goals and I decided to check it out.  I joined the Miss Chinatown Hawaii pageant because I am half Chinese and wanted to learn more about my cultural heritage.  A typical beauty pageant consists of four catagories: question/answer, swimwear, talent, and evening gown. And so I asked myself "Talent?  But I am not talented?!".  Well I had about eight months to learn something new and perform in front of hundreds of people.
