Jake Acedo is a Hawaii Based Editorial and InSalon Stylist. From doing Hair for Hawaii's top Fashion Magazines like Alamoana,Modern Luxury, and HiLuxury (to name a few) and working in salon giving his clients the latest trends, Jake Acedo has emerged himself into his artistry. 

Started his career working at one of Honolulu's top salon and assisting one of Hawaii's best stylist gave Jake the opportunity and education to be the best. "Being able to assist was the greatest thing I've done, i got to really be in my mentor's shoe and almost see what goes on in an artists mind" Jake says. Creating his first Hair Collection titled "Acconciature" in a private industry event, Jake raised the bar for his cutting edge style and really put his name out in Honolulu. Now Jake Acedo is working in the beautiful town of Kailua at the Foundry in an intimate creative setting.

Have you ever dreamed of becoming a model?  I have, and it was such an honor to be scouted by Hawaii top hair stylist, Jake Acedo.  I had the opportunity to work with him and his superstar team which included Glenn Anthony (Dreamlight Photography), Ari South (Project Runway), Miss Hawaii USA, Miss Hawaii Teen USA, and top make-up artists/stylists in Hawaii.  I was one of Jake's models to showcase his collection of avant garde designs.  The process included local runways, videography, and published print photography.

Acconciature is one of Jake's largest showcase.  It was a three month process just to get ready for the show.  First the video I posted above was made to be played during the opening of the large runway show hosted by W Salon which was held at the Ala Moana Shopping Center for their annual Shop o' Lea event. If you noticed my hair in the video is an orange-red shade (yes, it's all my real hair!) which was the pantone color of the year in 2012.  Jake made some avant garde hair pieces to be put in during the main runway event, I had four completely different hairstyles/hair color within that three month time frame.  Besides the obvious of being a model, myself and the other models had our own 'homework' to assist with wardrobing, choreography, and just any ideas and suggestions to make this a fabulous event!

The whole event was a positive experience and I was scouted for more jobs in modeling afterward.  This has even led me to sign with Hawaii's top modeling agency Premier Models and Talent.  It is such a treat to work on avant garde videography/photography as the Hawaii market is typically swimsuit and commercials.
