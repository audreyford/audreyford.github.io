In 2013, it has been a year since I dabbled into the modeling and acting world.  I have done local fashion runways, photoshoots for local shops in Hawaii and a friend of mine (she goes by Dj Nocturna) asks if I would be interested in doing a local television show she was producing.  The show was called Miss Vamp Hawaii and it would run locally for six months on the network KFVE.  A fun fact about me: I grew up listening to 80s rock and 90s grunge so I was naturally drawn to the vampire concept of this show.

I had a lot of fun participating in this, it was not only me, but there were ten other contestants participating as well.  Miss Vamp Hawaii was made as an alternative beauty pageant accepting all women, of all ages, race, size, etc.  I loved the all inclusive meaning behind this and how production asked for input from all of the contestants on what they wanted to showcase in the episodes.  My favorite episode was when we did a Hawaiian ghost tour.  The show was filmed with a reality TV show angle and each of us gave input on where we would like to be filmed, equipment needed, studio time, etc.  This show was made entirely on the producer's budget (Dj Nocturna and Lana) so all of the wardrobe, hair, make-up, was done by the contestants.  

Everyday is Halloween on the set of Miss Vamp Hawaii.  The TV series also led up to an event at The Hawaii Theatre where each of the 'Vamps' showcased a talent, wardrobe, and the highlight of the evening 'moon-bathing'.  I have done the acting side of commercials before but it was really cool to see how all of these things come together to be broadcasted.  To be behind the scenes of what goes on to make a TV show is definitely not something you get to do everyday.
