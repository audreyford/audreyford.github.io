Do you want to get hacked?  No, I don’t mean having your security breached and/or information stolen.   I am referring to the essay by Eric Raymond “How to Ask Questions the Smart Way” where he refers to developers as ‘hackers’.  As a software developer, no matter what your level is (newbie to advanced)  the internet is your best resource; whether it be a Google search, reading manuals, or asking your fellow software developers (hackers) on forums and/or email, you will have questions!  If you do decide to ask hackers on forums for advice, please remember to have proper etiquette to ensure your chances of getting hacked.

## Smart

Here is a ‘smart’ way of asking a question from Stack Overflow (I have included a snippet of this question and a link to review for reference down below.).  First, the user states the platform they are using along with their problem in the subject line so hackers can easily find and reply to the issue.  The user gets right to the point in their message with no small talk (“I know this is a dumb question.”) so it is easily readable and does not waste anyone’s time.  This user has already put in their own work with their own code to review and what steps they have already taken on this issue so hackers are willing to collaborate to form a solution because after all this is a free forum, why would a professional hacker give out information for free?  A collaboration ensures that both parties are putting in equal work.  You can see by the replies, hackers are helping to find this user a solution.  Lastly, the user thanks participants for their time; just a simple thank you can have a huge impact and ensure collaborations in the future.

## Not so smart

Here is a ‘not so smart’ way of asking a question from Stack Overflow (I have included a snippet of this question and a link to review for reference down below.).  First, the user does not bother to use spell check or check their own grammar before posting.  Their problem is also a an easily solvable problem with a quick Google search.  The very first sentence is filled with small talk noting that the solution has already been solved elsewhere and this posting ends with this user asking hackers for a ‘freebie’ because it is a “time-taking process”.  This user is not a fellow ‘hacker’ but a ‘loser’ as described by Eric Raymond.  There is no real solution posted because this is not worth the time for a real hacker to answer.  

## Ask the right questions, get on the same level

As you can see, asking the right questions will lead to effective and efficient help.  You can actually see if anyone views your question on Stack Overflow.  The ‘smart’ question has more views because it attracted the attention of other hackers and is helping other developers with the same issue.  The ‘not so smart’ question has very little views because the subject line does not catch much attention and the lack of responses show that it is not worth any hackers’ time to merit a response.  Hackers will help other hackers; get on the same level or be subject to ridicule.
