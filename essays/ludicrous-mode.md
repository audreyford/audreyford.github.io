I love cars, and I love technology; self-driving cars?  Absolutely!  Sign me up!  As of now there are currently no fully self-driving vehicles available to the public for purchase.  However, I am a proud owner of a Tesla which is probably the closest thing you can get to a fully autonomous vehicle right now and the comments I get regarding the ‘Autopilot’ (semi-autonomous driving) feature is just absolutely ludicrous.

## Are self-driving cars ethical

“Are self-driving cars ethical?”, “I just saw in the news…is it true?”.  Let me ask you this, is it ethical to make assumptions on a product you have been wrongly informed about?  No, it is not.  Tesla’s are built to be full self- driving however that software is not yet available to the general public.  It is not ethical to have selective hearing on factual information, that is how you spread misleading information.  Autonomous vehicles as of now are more of an extra set of eyes on the wheel, not your personal chauffer…yet.  “Will it react quick enough to dodge a pedestrian that decides to jump right in front of you?”  Same question but how quick would you react in that same scenario?  Definitely a lot quicker with an extra set of eyes on the wheel that’s for sure!  A product that has the user’s best interest and has no intent on harming others is ethical in my book.

## Ask Smart Questions

As a software engineer it is ethical to ask smart questions and do your research before coming to a conclusion.   When you do your own research, you can find out if something is in your best interest and how it affects society.  Be an early adopter and spread the facts; you do not want to be the one missing out on something great!
