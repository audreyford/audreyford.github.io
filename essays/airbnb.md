Without being a professional developer, I think we can all relatively eyeball code and tell if it looks pleasant or not.  Code evenly spaced out with indents where they should be is definitely more legible than a bunch of lines bunched up all together.  But why are coding standards important?  Four weeks into the semester we started using IntelliJ while implementing ESLint and the AirBnB JavaScript Coding Standards.  Why AirBnB?  Did the professor make this up for fun just like our Jamba Juice WOD?  Actually, the AirBnB JavaScript Coding Standards is used worldwide and is being implemented by many companies such as: General Electric, National Geographic, Reddit, Target, Zillow, etc.

## Why are coding standards important?

Again, why is having coding standards important?  As a professional developer your future employer will be paying you to write code; the code may run but if they are paying for a service, why would they choose to purchase something sloppy?  Besides the obvious of having nice looking code/code that is easier to read, having a coding standard is useful in collaborative environments.  Everyone will have their favorite way of writing code, but it will be confusing and/or ugly to read if you do not decide on a coding standard.  Worst case your code may not even run at all but having a set coding standard will help prevent that from happening because it will make naming functions and variables more predictable, and it will be easier to eyeball your errors in neatly formatted code.

## Time

After my first week of ESLint with IntelliJ, checking off all of those preference boxes is annoying and takes up some time in the WOD if you are new to this like I am.  But I however do feel that this is necessary to learn in becoming a better developer and to learn a programming language.  How does it help me you ask?  That green check mark helps keep me in check because as a new developer it keeps me from developing bad habits.  It also helps me catch my mistakes quicker, some things like a missing curly bracket or using double instead of single quotes can mind boggle me much longer than it would have been to write the code and time is definitely something I do not want to waste - especially during a WOD.

## AirBnB | ESLint are relevant

I have never used the AirBnB app itself and I probably will not be using it anytime soon (I love staying in hotels) but there is no denying the impact of their JavaScript Coding Standards along with ESLint.   This is not something the professor made up just to throw into the curriculum that we will never see again.  I really do enjoy learning the modules, languages, and software in this course and I am looking forward to implementing them as a software developer.
