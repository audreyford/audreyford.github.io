## Overview

College courses are challenging.  Sometimes it's hard to find someone to study with or maybe you are unable to make your TA's office hours.  I think having an application where you can find someone who wants to study with you or someone who is available for tutoring services.

## Approach

Users will make their own profile with their major, classes they are taking, and times available.  They would also need to list if they want to study with someone or if they are looking for someone to tutor them.  This helps students by helping them find peers who also need help, and there are also students who actually work on campus as tutors but some students do not even know their services are available.

## Mock up page ideas

Landing page
User home page
Admin home page
User profile page
Calendar page

## Use case ideas

New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile.
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
User goes to landing page, logs in, requests study buddy or tutor.
User is notified if someone responds to their request.

## Beyond the basics

Login using UH CAS to guarantee that all users are UH students.
Slack integration to facilitate notification and organization of meetings.
A rating system to rate the help from tutors.
