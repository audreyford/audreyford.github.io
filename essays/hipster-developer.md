As a ‘Baby Developer’, UI Frameworks is completely new to me.  What do I think of it so far?  I have only just recently dipped my toes into HTML and CSS.  UI Frameworks to me is  HTML and CSS’s ‘Hipster’ relative.  Both raw HTML and CSS, and UI Frameworks will get the job done but I personally find UI Frameworks much more modern, fun, and pleasing to look it.  It is not for everyone, but I am a millennial and I personally like all this cool, new, modern interface.

## HTML and CSS's 'Hipster' relative

But why bother learning and using Semantic UI?  What is the benefit?  One, because it simply looks cool, and Two, because you get a more quality product compared to raw HTML and CSS.  For example, I could go to a dive-bar and order an old fashioned for $8, but do I want to? No.  I prefer to go to those trendy, hipster-bars where they use a perfectly round (or a large square) ice cube with a nice Japanese whiskey and pay $18 for it.  Same idea when you start taking on clients as a developer; Why sell yourself short by making web pages in raw HTML and CSS when you could increase your value by including some UI Framework doing the same job!  

## Why sell yourself short?

Do you use social media?  My favorite part of Semantic UI is the abundance of modern icons you can link to your webpage.  I also love emojis; gone are the days of the colon and parenthesis smiley faces.  Icons and emoji are trendy so it will definitely garner more foot traffic compared to a raw website and that is why the client hired a professional to design such a webpage instead of making it themselves.

## Hipster Trendy

In the end, it really all is a preference thing.  There are people who love simplicity.  Trendy is definitely more popular and will grab more attention, but sometimes all you need is something subtle to get the job done.
