I would currently consider myself what I would call a ‘Baby Developer’.  I am a newbie when it comes to programming;  I have only taken classes on Java, C, and C++ so far.  You are probably wondering how/why I got into programming/development?  During my teenage years, is when I got into online journals and social networking.  In middle school, a web journal called Xanga was really popular among myself and my peers.  I would spend hours designing the perfect layout with my favorite colors and pictures of my favorite musicians as the theme.  When I was in high school, that was when MySpace came out.  It was pretty much Xanga on steroids; I created my own page layout, added my favorite song/music video to play in the background, and adding sparkly gifs to my friend’s comment section.  As a kid, I had no idea I was actually dabbling in Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

## Javascript, HTML, CSS

MySpace had their success but it was drowned out when Facebook arrived.  I was bummed out because I was actually into updating my layout more than I was the social networking aspect so working on this professional portfolio was a bit nostalgic to me.   While I was probably doing more HTML and CSS in this assignment more than Javascript, I feel that all three languages go hand in hand with each other in web development.  We dealt purely in Javascript in ES06 in freecodecamp.com where I found that knowing other programming languages already made me feel at ease in writing Javascript (if not, more efficient).  From a software engineering prospective I think Javascript is like a more simplified Java; you can update your data as you go, you can make all sorts of functions, and making arrays are easier and simplified.

## Athletic software engineering

To get better at Javascript athletic software engineering is quite useful since it’s a good way to practice and develop my skills on the daily.  I do admit I get very anxious during practice our practice WODs in class but was pleasantly surprised to see myself doing well.  Besides getting better at Javascript, I think athletic software engineering will help me overcome this negative anxious feeling to become something I can look forward to!

## Does not feel like a chore

From my informal self-taught adventure in web development as a teenager to dipping my toes into Javascript in ICS 314, I think I might have found one of my new favorite languages to work with.  While there is a lot of work into learning Javascript, HTML, and CSS in web development, time flies when you actually enjoy the learning process so it does not feel like a chore.
