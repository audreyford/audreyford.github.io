In life, structures or patterns are necessary on how we do day to day things whether it be for personal reasons, work, academic, etc.  Whether we like it or not, these design patterns become necessary to make things efficient and organized.  How do I know it is efficient?  It gets my job done right?  And these patterns are organized since I would use different design patterns for different tasks.

## Mundane Tasks

When I wake up in the morning, I don’t realize I am picking out a design pattern in such a mundane task as applying my make-up.  I will use a different technique depending on the look I am going for that day: natural, smoky-eyes, or maybe no make-up at all!  Each of these will require a different design pattern to implement but still rely on a simple base of doing it after a skincare routine.

## Selecting a Desgin Pattern

For work, I used to help homeowners look into getting solar panels for their homes.   I would go through a questionnaire with them about their home’s roof type, location, energy consumption, etc.  From there I can decide if they are even a candidate for solar panels and which design pattern, we would need to implement to get the job done.

## Subconciously Creating Our Own

As you can see, whether I am applying make-up or designing solar panels for a client I am using some sort of design patterns.  While most will relate to design patterns in implementation of code, it applies perfectly in all aspects of your life.  In class,  I am using a prototype design pattern where we have different class collections, we can call on depending on the situation.  My different classes for my project would be the type of clubs and members  compared to roof classes at work or classes of make-up in my personal routine.  We unknowing use design patterns and we all subconsciously create our own!
