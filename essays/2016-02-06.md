What is a computer?  According to Merriam-Webster the definition of a computer is “one that computes; specifically; a programmable usually electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process data.”.  A computer to me is a device that provides education, banking, entertainment, and increase productivity.  I use the computer every day or a similar device such as a cellphone, car, tablet, etc. and I cannot imagine someone to not be using technology in this day and age.

## My first memory of a computer

My first memory of a computer was my very first HP desktop computer when I was 4 years old.  It was running Windows ’95 and I did not have internet back then.  My use back then was just for entertainment by playing computer games.  I played Minesweeper; to this day I do not even know how to play the game.  I remember going to the store and buying CDs to install software onto my computer.  As I got older I was learning how to type through word processor and saved my items to a floppy disk.  From Kindergarten, we had computer lab classes so I grew up learning about computers.

## I am using a computer right now

As we speak, I am using a computer right now.  I am using a word processor to type this essay and with internet access to submit this assignment.  I use the computer as a form of communication through email, social media, video chat, instant messenger, etc.  The stock market used to be through the newspaper and calling a broker and now you can trade online.  I prefer to do my shopping online instead of at the store now and I can make reservations to restaurants, salons, etc. without having to pick up the phone.  I do not even watch cable television anymore as I have subscriptions to Netflix and YouTube.  The radio seems obsolete to me now as internet radio with customizable playlists play the songs you want and save you money from purchasing music.  The computer is constantly evolving and making life more efficient by getting your day to day needs done.

## Computer science

What brought me into computer science?  I love, and have grown up with computers and use it in every aspect of my life.  Computers and technology are a huge industry with many different career paths such as programming, sales, web/graphic design, etc. Growing up I have always been a creative person and there are many different ways I can be creative in the computer/technology field.  

## Almost everything is a computer

Almost everything we interact with is a computer these days.  I think a main feature of a computer would be it requiring user input either physically or through programming and algorithms.  While some things such as a cellphone/smartphone and tablet have many similarities to a computer, a difference would be that it lacks the hardware to do heavy duty data processing and may not have access to the same software as a computer.  A programmable washer/dryer would need your input on how you would like your clothes washed/dried and just follows the same command until you change it but does not really have capabilities beyond that.  While driverless cars are not yet available but are being actively tested; I have a Tesla which is currently a semi-autonomous vehicle built to be self-driving, and I also have a Roomba a robot vacuum cleaner: both the Tesla and Roomba use sensors, cameras, and radars to be autonomous and they also do not have the access to the same software, capabilities to do heavy processing as a computer, and just being mobile would be the biggest difference.  Artificial intelligence is a big industry right now; robots are being developed and self-serving kiosks are making cashiers a thing of the past.  Robot dogs replacing the services of dogs and acting as pets you don’t need to care for but the thing they all have in common with the computer is needing user input from a person.

## Constantly updating

Computers are constantly updating.  A computer 5, 10, or even just a year ago easily becomes very outdated quickly.  Computers have greatly come down in price due to faster/easier production and are more easily attainable than they were 20 years ago.  My first computer, I did not have internet, then came dial up internet, and now if it’s not high-speed internet then it is not relevant.  However, throughout the years computers still have their same use by being programmable, storing, receiving, and processing data.

## Security and algorithms

Although in 2, 5, or even 10 years from now the computer will greatly change.  Computers are being more intelligent with facial, iris, finger print recognition, etc.  Websites have algorithms that bring up things you may be interested in.  I can definitely see driverless cars being very common and less service jobs being available in the future because they will be replaced by robots.

## User input

In conclusion, a computer I believe is a device requiring your user input that helps refine your day to day life.  A computer is meant to do functions to help take the work load off for you and/or refine what you already can do by being faster, neater, cleaner, etc.  Everyone has a computer and perhaps multiple types of computing devices plus many more being developed in the future.  The computer does exactly what we want/program it to do so I am studying computer science because computers make my life easier.
